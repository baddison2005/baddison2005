## Welcome to the GitHub Repository of Dr. Brett Addison!

###### *Astrophysicist Â· Data Scientist*

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am astrophysicist currently transitioning into data science. I am very passionate about science, astronomy, mathematics, statistics, and data science.

Here you will find projects that I have worked on and code I have written to analyze data. I am always keen to explore new ideas and develop new projects in astronomy and data science. If you would like to collaborate on a project, please do reach out via my email at <baddison2005@gmail.com>!

I have recently started a data science blog post series, which you can find on my website at <https://www.astrobrett.com/data_science.html>. If you are interested in the research work I did as a professional astronomer, focused primarily on the discovery and characterization of exoplanets, please also check out my website <https://www.astrobrett.com/>.
